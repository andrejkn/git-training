## .gitignore

.gitignore is a simple text file that tells git what files and/or paths should not be tracked. When doing commands like git add, git status, etc files and paths in the .gitignore will not be included.

It is generally considered good practice not to include files managed by package mangers like node_modules for npm packages, or bower_components for bower.

It is also a good idea not to commit artifacts that are generated as part of a build process. Github has a collection of sample .gitignore files for many different enviroments/setups located [here](https://github.com/github/gitignore)

An example ignore file:

```
# Logs
logs
*.log

# Runtime data
pids
*.pid
*.seed

# Directory for instrumented libs generated by jscoverage/JSCover
lib-cov

# Coverage directory used by tools like istanbul
coverage

# Grunt intermediate storage (http://gruntjs.com/creating-plugins#storing-task-files)
.grunt

# Compiled binary addons (http://nodejs.org/api/addons.html)
build/Release

# Dependency directory
# Commenting this out is preferred by some people, see
