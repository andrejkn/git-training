TODO/NOTE: still copy & paste of Bertrands notes

## Rebasing

`git rebase <name of branch to rebase off>`

As you work and even as you finish, integrate your changes with `master` regularly.

---

## Rebasing (continued)

Rebasing changes the base of your branch to the last commit found on another branch, `master` in this case, and replays your changes on top. In essence, the history is rewritten to make it appear that your work was always done after the latest master.

## Squashing your commits

`git rebase -i <name of branch to rebase off>`

Pick the first commit on your feature branch and squash all subsequent ones on top of it.

This process combines them all into one commit.
