## Rebasing

Usage:

`git rebase <name of branch to rebase off>`

As you work and even as you finish, integrate your changes with `master` regularly.

Rebasing changes the base of your branch to the last commit found on another branch, `master` in this case, and replays your changes on top. In essence, the history is rewritten to make it appear that your work was always done after the latest master.

When you have created a branch, it is a good idea to keep in sync with the master branch. By rebasing frequently, you can help minimize conflicts, and makes it easier for your changes to be integrated into master when you are ready to prepare a pull request.

## Squashing your commits

`git rebase -i <name of branch to rebase off>`

Pick the first commit on your feature branch and squash all subsequent ones on top of it.

This process combines them all into one commit.
